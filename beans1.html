<h1>Beans!</h1>
<h3>April 19th</h3>
<p>On Sunday, April 12th, I planted some pole beans!</p>

<p>Pole bean are beans that grow as long vines and require a pole or some other type of support to stay off the ground.</p>
<p>You want to keep the beans off the ground because they might rot if the beans or the leaves come in contact with the moist soil.</p>
<p>This is what I planted:</p>
<p>Stringless Blue Lake FM1K (pole)</p>
<p> Kentucky Wonder, Rust Resistant (pole)</p>
<p> I'm not sure what FM1K means.  If you have a guess, let me know! </p>

<p>On the back of the seed envelopes, it said "Days to Germinate: 6-8",
and, sure enough, in 7 days the beans sprouted, and the pumpkins sprouted later that day.</p>

<p>Here is what the tiny, baby, just sprouted beans looked like:</p>

<p></p>

<p>And, here's how the chives are doing! They are 5 weeks from planting in this photo:</p>
