        <h1 class="papyrus">Chive Mini-Lesson</h1>
    
        <h3 class="papyrus">April 7, 2020</h3>
    
        <p>Today we had scheduled a TLD Afternoon in the Garden, but, of course, the school is closed, and we are all keeping our distance from others, so we are not gathering in the garden.  So, I thought I'd send out a little mini garden lesson, all about planting chives from seed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="opaque">
        <p class="papyrus">First, I found a chive seed packet:</p>
        <img src="chives_seedpacketfront_resize.jpg" class="chives-pics">
    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
        <p class="papyrus">Whenever you get a seed packet, don't forget to read the back:</p>
    
        <img src="chives_seedpacketback_resize.jpg" class="chives-pics">
    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
        <p>But, sometimes the back of a seed packet seems really complicated.  So, here's what all of that means (you might have to zoom in):</p>
    
        <img src="chives_seedpacketback_ann_resize.jpg" class="seed-pics">
    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
        <p>Once I read the packet, I opened it up and checked out the seeds!  Chive seeds are small and black.  This photo shows them next to pumpkin seeds and a pencil, so you can tell how tiny they are.  They are very easy to lose, so I put them on a plate.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
        <p class="papyrus">Next, I found a nice place to plant the seeds, with clean dirt.</p>
        <p>I picked up any rocks or leaves around the soil.  Since chive seeds are so small, it is very hard to dig individual holes for the seeds.  Instead, I put the seeds on top of the soil, and then gently sprinkled a little soil over the top of them.  Then I watered gently.  Seeds should always be watered gently, so they don't wash away!</p>

        <p>I planted my seeds March 14th.  This photo was taken April 1st, the first day the seeds sprouted:</p>

        <p>My seeds took 15 days to sprout - but the packet said 7-10 days.  Can you guess why mine took longer?  (Hint, think about the weather in March - was it hot, cold, or warm?)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
        <p class="papyrus">Then, this is what the sprouts look like today, one week later:</p>
    
        <img src="chives_oneweeklater_crop.jpg" class="chives-pics">

        <p>Just a little bit bigger.  I will keep watering them, and I hope that the chives I planted look as good as the ones on the front of the seed packet by summer!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="opaque">
    <p>Keep observing the world around you.  Spring has sprung, and plants are growing all around you - see if you can see differences each day.</p>
    
    <p class="papyrus">Happy gardening everyone!<p>
